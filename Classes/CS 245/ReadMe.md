# Employee Records Final Project by Tony Liang

The Employee Records software was an undergraduate project developed by a computer science student of the College of Engineering, Computer Science and Technology (ECST) in California State 
University of Los Angeles (Cal State LA) for the Using Operating System & Network for Programmers class. The developer, Tony Liang, was a computer science undergraduate.

The software is a database system, which keeps records of employees' data. The user must provide the database and its login credentials. Then, the software will create the Employee table in 
the database and the user can provide a Comma-separated values (CSV) file containing the employees' data. Finally, the user can add, update, delete, display, or search employee(s) in the 
database.
